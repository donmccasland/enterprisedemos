This code will trigger a cloudbuild build when a CVE fix is detected
in the container marked 'latest' in a watched registry. The hope is
that rebuilding will bring in the fix from the parent repo.

To deploy the CVE based trigger, edit the main.py with your GCP project, 
GCR registry name to watch, and the CloudBuild trigger to run, and
then run the command:
./bin/setup

You MUST run this from the cve-trigger directory
